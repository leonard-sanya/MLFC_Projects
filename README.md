# Accessâ€“Assessâ€“Address Framework  

The **Accessâ€“Assessâ€“Address** framework provides a systematic approach to structuring data science projects.  
It helps to ensure that we donâ€™t just gather data, but also critically evaluate it before addressing the actual research or business question.  

---

## Framework Overview  

- **Access**: *How do we get the data?*  
  This includes APIs, web scraping, database queries, file formats, and more.  

- **Assess**: *How do we evaluate the data?*  
  This means checking data quality, exploring its structure, and validating assumptions.  

- **Address**: *How do we solve the problem?*  
  This is where we apply models, perform analysis, and answer the research question.

## Applying the Framework  

### ðŸ”¹ Access Functionality  

**What weâ€™ve created**  
- Connection to **OpenStreetMap (OSM)** via the [OSMnx](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx) library.  
- Retrieval of geographic data points (`get_osm_datapoints`).  

**What we might need to add**  
- Legal and ethical considerations (e.g., usage limits, licensing, and privacy concerns).  
- Support for alternative data sources (APIs, databases).  

---

### ðŸ”¹ Assess Functionality  

**What weâ€™ve created**  
- `plot_city_map()`: Visualize OSM data for any location.  
- `get_feature_vector()`: Extract quantitative features from geographic coordinates.  
- Feature summarization (counts of amenities, shops, landmarks, etc.).  
- Dimensionality reduction (`PCA`, `t-SNE`) for visualizing patterns in feature space.  

**What we could create**  
- Automated data quality checks (handling missing data, failed queries).  
- Consistency and validity checks across multiple cities/datasets.  

---

### ðŸ”¹ Address Functionality  

**What weâ€™ve created**  
- Machine learning pipeline for **location classification**.  
- Training and evaluation of classifiers (`logistic regression`, etc.).  
- Model performance analysis and bias assessment.  

**What we could add**  
- More advanced ML models (random forests, gradient boosting, neural networks).  
- Fairness and interpretability assessments.  
- Deployment-ready pipeline.
